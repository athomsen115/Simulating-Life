Karplusâ€“Strong string synthesis is a method of physical modelling synthesis that loops a short waveform through a filtered delay line to simulate the sound of a hammered or plucked string or some types of percussion.

In this example, it synthesizes the pentatonic minor scale on the piano.

Also included are the WAV files generated by running the program.
