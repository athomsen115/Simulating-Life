Included in here is the code needed, a sample art photo to turn into a photomosaic, but you can use any photo of your choice, and the same photo turned into a photomosaic.

I have included some sample photos to use, but I recommend downloading more of your own. A great website to get high quality photos in bulk is http://unsample.net/. For individual photos, check out https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsample&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit
